# Hypersonics
## Introduction
### What is Hypersonics?
Hypersonics is the study of anything relating to the objects at speeds higher than Mach 5. It can be broadly classified into 4 different subdisciplines
- **Structures**: The structure of any hypersonic vehicle must be able to withstand the high speeds of hypersonic flight. Compared to subsonic (below mach 1) and transsonic (Mach 1 to 5), the need for a good strucutral design is much more stringent

- **Guidance + Control**: Guidance and control is absolutely essential for most hypersonic crafts. This is because most of current application of hypersonics require a way to guide the craft somewhere. Even in terms of weapons, hypersonic missile require a certain amount of guarantee to hit a target. 

* **Propulsion**: The propulsion systems of Hypersonic vehicles are fundamentally different than the traditional propulsion systems. The propulsion systems for hypersonic vehicles need to be intergrated into the frame of the craft to decrease drag and ensure the correct flow of air. Often the propulsion systems cannot even have moving parts. Because of the harsh conditions in the upper atmosphere, there is a very limited amount of time within the within the engine to burn fuel and oxidizer, meaning that the propulsion systems must be well designed.
  
- **Aerothermodynamics**:
