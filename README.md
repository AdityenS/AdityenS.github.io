### Introduction
Hypersonics is the study of anything relating to the objects at speeds higher than Mach 5. It can be broadly classified into 4 different subdisciplines
- **Structures**

- **Guidance + Control**

* **Propulsion**: The propulsion systems of Hypersonic vehicles are fundamentally different than the traditional propulsion systems. The propulsion systems for hypersonic vehicles need to be intergrated into the frame of the craft.  
- **Aerothermodynamics**:
